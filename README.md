# Mathematics for Machine Learning

A learning companion for the mathematics behind Machine Learning.  
This repository follows my MSc in Business Analytics â€“ Computational Intelligence (VU Amsterdam).  
Its purpose is to document and clarify the mathematical concepts from my coursework,  
ensuring that each lecture is 100% mathematically understood.

## Why this repo  

- Keep my MSc notes structured and accessible.  
- Clarify difficult mathematical concepts with my own explanations.  
- Collect assignments and comments in one place.  
- Build a public academic portfolio to share

## Topics roadmap

This repository follows my MSc coursework. Each topic will eventually include:
- **Summary of notes and comments**
- **Assignments**
- **Other comments or sections**

### Courses

ðŸ“˜ Current material: [Lecture 1: Preliminaries](docs/advanced-ml/lecture01.pdf)

By the end of Year 1, I plan to add:  

2. Dynamic Programming & Reinforcement Learning  
3. Project Optimization of Business Processes  
4. Project Reinforcement Learning  
5. Time Series Models  
6. Data Mining Techniques  
7. Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
8. Machine Learning for the Quantified Self (QS)

Year 2 and **Thesis** will be added later.
