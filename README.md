# Mathematics for Machine Learning

A public, hands-on companion to the mathematical foundations of ML. Built with clear explanations, proofs, and executable notebooks in Python (with notes bridging to Julia, R, and MATLAB where helpful).

## Why this repo
- Show the *math behind the methods* in a practical way.
- Help students (and my future self) go from definition → theorem → intuition → code.
- Build an open portfolio as I start my Master's in Business Analytics (Computational Intelligence) at VU Amsterdam.

## Topics roadmap

This repository follows my MSc coursework. Each topic will eventually include:
- **Summary of notes and comments**
- **Assignments**
- **Other comments or sections**

### 1. Advanced Machine Learning
*(coming soon)*

---

By the end of Year 1, I plan to add:
2. Dynamic Programming & Reinforcement Learning  
3. Project Optimization of Business Processes  
4. Project Reinforcement Learning  
5. Time Series Models
6. Data Mining Techniques  
7. Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
8. Machine Learning for the Quantified Self (QS)

Year 2 and **Thesis** will be added later.
